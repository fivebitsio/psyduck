description: Learn how to install the Psyduck Tracker on your website. This guide covers both the client-side tracking code and server-side setup.
---

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Psyduck Tracker, you need:

1. A running Psyduck Analytics server
2. Access to your website's HTML code
3. Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript

## Server Setup

First, you'll need to have the Psyduck Analytics server running. If you haven't set it up yet, build the single binary:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fivebitsio/psyduck.git

# Install dependencies
cd psyduck
bun install

# Build the single executable
bun run build:standalone
```

This creates a single binary at `./dist/psyduck` that you can use as just `psyduck`.

## Database Migration

The Psyduck Tracker uses DuckDB as its database. Before starting the server, you need to run the database migrations to set up the required tables and types.

### Running Migrations

To apply all pending migrations:

```bash
psyduck migrate up
```

This will:
- Create the `device_type` enum (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Create the `events` table with all required columns
- Track which migrations have been applied

### Migration Options

You can customize the migration process:

```bash
# Use a custom database file
psyduck migrate --db ./custom.db

# Use a custom migrations directory
psyduck migrate --migrations ./custom-migrations

# Rollback the last migration
psyduck migrate down

# Rollback a specific number of migrations
psyduck migrate down --number 2

# Rollback all migrations
psyduck migrate down --number all

# Show help for migration options
psyduck migrate --help
```

## Configuration Initialization

The Psyduck Tracker requires initial configuration including a JWT key and at least one user account.

### Initial Configuration

Initialize the application configuration with an initial user account:

```bash
psyduck init
```

### Adding Additional Users

To add additional users after the initial setup:

```bash
psyduck init --add-user
```

This will prompt you to enter an email and password for the new user.

### Configuration File

The configuration is stored in `data/config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "hashed_password"
    }
  ],
  "jwtKey": "your-jwt-secret-key",
  "demoMode": false
}
```

When `demoMode` is set to `true`, analytics endpoints are accessible without authentication, which is useful for development and testing.

## Client-Side Installation

There are two ways to install the tracker on your website:

### Option 1: Script Tag (Recommended)

Add the following script tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML pages:

```html
<script 
  src="https://tracker.psyduck.click/track.js" 
  data-domain="https://tracker.psyduck.click" 
  defer>
</script>
```

Alternatively, you can use your self-hosted instance:

```html
<script 
  src="http://localhost:9876/track.js" 
  data-domain="http://localhost:9876" 
  defer>
</script>
```

The hosted version at `https://tracker.psyduck.click` is recommended for most users as it requires no server setup.

### Option 2: Manual Initialization

If you need more control over when the tracker initializes, you can load the script manually and initialize it:

```html
<script src="https://tracker.psyduck.click/track.js" defer></script>
<script>
  // Initialize the tracker after the script loads
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    Psyduck.init({
      domain: 'https://tracker.psyduck.click'  // Recommended hosted domain
      // or
      // domain: 'https://your-psyduck-server.com'  // Self-hosted instance
    });
  });
</script>
```

## Verification

To verify that tracking is working:

1. Open your website in a browser
2. Open the browser's developer tools (F12)
3. Go to the Network tab
4. Refresh the page
5. Look for requests to your Psyduck server

You should see a POST request to `/events` with event data.

## Running the Server

After installation and configuration, you can run the Psyduck Tracker server in different ways:

### Running the Server

After installation and configuration, you can run the Psyduck Analytics server in different ways:

### Production Mode

For production deployment, use the built binary:

```bash
# Run the server from the built binary
./dist/psyduck server
```

This starts the Psyduck server, making the API available at `http://localhost:9876`.

### Development Mode

For development with hot reloading:

```bash
# Run the development server directly
bun run dev
```

This command starts the server directly using Bun for development, making the API available at `http://localhost:9876`.

### Interactive Mode

You can also use the interactive CLI mode:

```bash
# Run in interactive mode to select commands
./dist/psyduck interactive
```
