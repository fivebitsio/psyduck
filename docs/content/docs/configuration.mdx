## Overview

The Psyduck configuration system manages:

- Authentication settings
- JWT token management
- User accounts and permissions
- Server settings
- Demo mode options

## Configuration File

The platform uses a JSON configuration file stored at `data/config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "hashed_password"
    }
  ],
  "jwtKey": "your-jwt-secret-key",
  "demoMode": false
}
```

# Configuration

Learn how to configure the Psyduck Tracker for your specific needs and requirements.

## Server Configuration

The Psyduck Tracker server can be configured through the config system. Configuration options are stored in `data/config.json`.

### Demo Mode

You can enable demo mode which allows analytics endpoints to be accessed without authentication:

```json
{
  "demoMode": true,
  "jwtKey": "your-jwt-secret-key"
}
```

When `demoMode` is `true`, the analytics endpoints will not require authentication, making it easier to test and develop.

### JWT Authentication

The system uses JWT-based authentication. The `jwtKey` is used to sign and verify tokens. Make sure to use a strong, unique key in production.

## Client-Side Configuration

### Initialization Options

The tracker can be initialized with the following options:

```javascript
Psyduck.init({
  domain: 'https://tracker.psyduck.click'  // Recommended hosted domain
  // or
  // domain: 'http://localhost:9876'  // Self-hosted instance
});
```

### Manual Event Tracking

You can track custom events with additional data:

```javascript
// Track a custom event
Psyduck.track('button-click', {
  customData: {
    buttonId: 'signup-button',
    page: 'landing'
  }
});

// Track other events
Psyduck.track('form-submit', {
  customData: {
    formId: 'contact-form',
    fields: ['name', 'email']
  }
});
```

### Advanced Configuration

For more advanced use cases, you can:

1. **Disable automatic page view tracking:**
   Do not call `Psyduck.track('page-view')` automatically after initialization.

2. **Custom event IDs:**
   By default, the tracker generates UUIDs for events. You can override this if needed.

3. **Custom data:**
   Include additional custom data with each event using the `customData` field.

## Tracking Parameters

The tracker automatically collects the following information:

- **Browser**: Detected from user agent (chrome, firefox, safari, etc.)
- **Device Type**: Mobile, tablet, or desktop based on screen size and touch support
- **Operating System**: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, etc.
- **Hostname**: The domain of the page being tracked
- **Pathname**: The path of the page being tracked
- **Referrer**: Where the visitor came from
- **Timezone**: Detected from the browser
- **UTM Parameters**: All UTM campaign tracking parameters
- **Event ID**: Unique identifier for the session

## Privacy Settings

The Psyduck Tracker is designed to be privacy-friendly:

- No personally identifiable information is collected
- No cookies are used
- All data is aggregated and anonymized
- IP addresses are not stored
- Only anonymous metrics are collected

## Data Retention

The system stores data in DuckDB which persists to disk. You're responsible for your own data retention policies and cleanup procedures.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with tracking:

1. Check that the server is running and accessible
2. Verify the domain URL is correct in the initialization
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify network requests are being made to your server
5. Ensure CORS is properly configured if needed
