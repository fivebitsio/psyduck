## General Deployment Steps

Before deploying to any specific platform, ensure you have:

1. **Environment Setup**: Install necessary dependencies (Bun, DuckDB)
2. **Database**: Ensure database migrations are applied (`psyduck migrate up`)
3. **Configuration**: Run initial configuration (`psyduck init`)
4. **Security**: Set up authentication and secure your installation

## Platform-Specific Deployment

### Hetzner Deployment

Hetzner is a German cloud hosting provider that offers reliable, cost-effective servers. Here's how to deploy the Psyduck Analytics on Hetzner.

#### Prerequisites

- A Hetzner account with a server instance running
- SSH access to your server
- Basic knowledge of Linux server administration

#### Server Setup on Hetzner

1. **Create a Hetzner Cloud Server**
   - Go to the Hetzner Cloud Console
   - Create a new server with at least 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
   - Choose Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the operating system
   - Select an SSH key for access

2. **Connect to Your Server**
   ```bash
   ssh root@your-server-ip
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Update system packages
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   
   # Install Bun runtime
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   
   # Make Bun available in PATH
   export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"
   
   # Install DuckDB dependencies
   apt install -y build-essential duckdb
   ```

4. **Deploy Psyduck**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/fivebitsio/psyduck.git
   cd psyduck
   
   # Install dependencies
   bun install
   
   # Build the single executable
   bun run build:standalone
   ```

5. **Configure the Application**
   ```bash
   # Run the configuration setup
   ./dist/psyduck init
   ```

6. **Run as a Service**
   To ensure the application runs reliably, set it up as a system service:
   
   Create a service file:
   ```bash
   nano /etc/systemd/system/psyduck.service
   ```
   
   Add the following configuration:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=Psyduck Analytics Service
   After=network.target
   
   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=psyduck
   WorkingDirectory=/home/psyduck/psyduck
   ExecStart=/home/psyduck/psyduck/dist/psyduck server
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=10
   Environment=PORT=9876
   
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
   
   Then enable and start the service:
   ```bash
   # Create a dedicated user for security
   useradd -m -s /bin/bash psyduck
   cp -r /root/psyduck /home/psyduck/psyduck
   chown -R psyduck:psyduck /home/psyduck/psyduck
   
   # Reload systemd and enable the service
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl enable psyduck
   systemctl start psyduck
   
   # Check the status
   systemctl status psyduck
   ```

7. **Set Up a Reverse Proxy (Optional)**
   For HTTPS and domain access, set up Nginx as a reverse proxy:
   
   ```bash
   # Install Nginx
   apt install nginx
   
   # Configure Nginx
   nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/psyduck
   ```
   
   Add the following configuration:
   ```
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;
       
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:9876;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```
   
   Enable the site:
   ```bash
   ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/psyduck /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   nginx -t
   systemctl restart nginx
   ```

8. **Enable HTTPS with Let's Encrypt**
   ```bash
   # Install Certbot
   apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   
   # Obtain certificate
   certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
   
   # Certbot will automatically update your Nginx configuration
   ```

#### Security Considerations

- Use a firewall (ufw) to restrict access
- Regularly update the system and dependencies
- Use SSH keys instead of passwords
- Set up monitoring and backup solutions
- Keep your domain DNS settings secure
